# Simplify the import patterns for user
# Instead of importing :
#   from ikats.algo.core.sax.sax import SAX, run_sax, run_sax_from_ds, run_sax_from_ts_list, run_sax_from_tsuid
# User will do:
#   from ikats.algo.core.sax import  SAX, run_sax, run_sax_from_ds, run_sax_from_ts_list, run_sax_from_tsuid

from pkgutil import extend_path
from ikats.algo.core.sax.sax import SAX, run_sax, run_sax_from_ds, run_sax_from_ts_list, run_sax_from_tsuid
